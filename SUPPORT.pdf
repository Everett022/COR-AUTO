**Required Sheet Structure and Headers**

The add-in expects the following sheets and columns in your Excel workbook:

1. **Ordering Sheet**
   - Table name: `OrderingTable`
   - Required columns (headers):
     - Case #
     - Demand
     - Current Inventory
     - On Order
     - Required Amount
     - Buy or Make
     - Earliest Start Date
   - The "Current Inventory" column is used to determine how many jobs can be covered/highlighted.

2. **Dynamic Sheet**
   - Required columns (headers):
     - Corrugate (item code)
     - Number of Corrugate (quantity)
     - Work Center
     - Planned Start (date)
     - Order Number (job number)
   - These columns are used for job and demand calculations.

3. **Inventory Sheet**
   - Required columns (headers):
     - Item Code
     - Inventory Date
     - Inventory Ref
     - Inventory Qty
     - Location
   - Used for inventory calculations and matching jobs to available stock.

If any of these columns are missing or misnamed, the add-in may not function correctly.

**Frequently Asked Questions & Troubleshooting**

1. **Installation Issues**
   - Ensure you are using the latest version of Excel and have enabled Office Add-ins.
   - The manifest must reference only HTTPS URLs (not localhost) and all icons must be the correct size (see manifest.xml for details).
   - If you see a permissions error, check that your manifest's <Permissions> are set appropriately (usually ReadWriteDocument).

2. **Display/Highlighting Not Working**
   - Make sure you have selected a case in the Ordering sheet. The display will only highlight jobs that can be covered by the current inventory for the selected case.
   - Inventory values must be set in the "Current Inventory" column of the Ordering sheet. The add-in uses this value to determine which jobs are covered.
   - If you update inventory or job data, refresh the taskpane or reselect the case to update the display.

3. **Manifest Validation Errors**
   - All URLs in the manifest must be HTTPS and public (not localhost or contoso.com).
   - Icon files must be exactly 32x32 and 64x64 pixels for IconUrl and HighResolutionIconUrl, respectively.
   - The privacy policy and EULA must be linked to public URLs (e.g., https://everett022.github.io/COR-AUTO/PRIVACY.pdf).

4. **General Usage**
   - The add-in reads job and inventory data from the "Ordering" and "Dynamic" sheets. Ensure your data is up to date.
   - If you encounter errors, check the browser console for details.
